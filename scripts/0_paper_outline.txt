#1. Analysis of returns.
# Want to know how resilient maker is to a recession
# Can examine either actual crashes or 1% tail events (do this as from BofE)
# So need to plot returns, KDE, find 0.1% scenario.
#Output --> Negative ETH price shock of size x%

#2. See how ETH liquidation vol varies with percentage price falls 
# Size x% shock implies y vol of ETH liquidated over certain period
# Moreover, question becomes: if a CDP triggered for liquidation at 150%, 
# could the market become so illiquid that there isn't time to sell before 100%?
    # Price falls below liquidation price - > liquidation triggered
    # Q: how quickly could price fall 33% (150 to 100)? Look historically

    # For a 1% fall in price, x CDPs liquidated
    # probability of 5% price fall is p(5%)
    # probability of subsequent 33% fall is p(33|5)
    # Need a conditional volatlity model
    # If you know the conditional probability of p(33|5), and you know the eth underwater, can work out VaR
