#1. Analysis of returns.
# Want to know how resilient maker is to a recession
# Can examine either actual crashes or 1% tail events (do this as from BofE)
# So need to plot returns, KDE, find 0.1% scenario.
#Output --> Negative ETH price shock of size x%

#2. See how ETH liquidation vol varies with percentage price falls 
# Size x% shock implies y vol of ETH liquidated over certain period
# Moreover, question becomes: if a CDP triggered for liquidation at 150%, 
# could the market become so illiquid that there isn't time to sell before 100%?
    # Price falls below liquidation price - > liquidation triggered
    # Q: how quickly could price fall 33% (150 to 100)? Look historically

    # For a 1% fall in price, x CDPs liquidated
    # probability of 5% price fall is p(5%)
    # probability of subsequent 33% fall is p(33|5)
    # Need a conditional volatlity model
    # If you know the conditional probability of p(33|5), and you know the eth underwater, can work out VaR


Say you have a lot of CDPs being efficiently maintained at 150% + some delta margin
What is the probability of a 33/% change in price of ETH, such that these CDPs would end up underwater?
    -> This probability will depend on timeframe. 
    --> Need plots of probability of a 33\% drop vs timeframe

There may have been such 33% drops before, but the point is, as finance gets the margins down, then the impact of a price corection is much more direct
So compare scenario (i), which is current situation, to scenario (ii), which is where all parties are trading at the limit (150%)
Now, if there is a price crash of 33%, it's unlikely that it will happen within hours etc
--> market participants would have a few hours in which to trade out of their ETH
--> hos effectively they can do this will depend on the market liquidity. Show plots, hour by hour.
---> crash precipitates when market isn't resilient enough / not enough liquidity to support the trading out of so much ETH

Emphasis needs to be on the impact of levered positions. If everyone only levers up 1x, then what's the ETH vol?
If everyone levers up 3x, what's the implied ETH vol then? (actually can see in CDPs)
But what about compound, dydx - these have DAI in them. so more ETH affected...
